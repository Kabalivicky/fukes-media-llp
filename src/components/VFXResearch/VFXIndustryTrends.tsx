                  In January 2023, most VFX studios increased their headcount during the busy period of 2022. 
                  By December 2023, the industry slowdown resulted in far fewer studios displaying growth, with 
                  many reducing their headcount.

                <p className="text-white/80">
                  Recovery has been slow through July 2024, with little change in headcount for many companies, 
                  suggesting that studios who reduced their workforce during 2023 had not yet fully recovered.

            <div className="space-y-4 text-white/80">
              <p>
                The VFX industry is in constant flux, with visual effects professionals traveling the world for work. 
                The continued growth of streaming platforms has created unprecedented demand for high-quality content 
                with sophisticated visual effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regional incentives continue to shape where VFX work is performed, with countries offering 
                competitive tax rebates to attract productions. This has led to the emergence of new hubs 
                beyond the traditional centers in North America and Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The integration of real-time technology and AI tools is reshaping workflows and creating new 
                specializations within the industry. Despite technological advances, the VFX industry remains 
                fundamentally human-powered, with demand for skilled artists continuing to grow globally.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the best ways to make careers in VFX more sustainable worldwide is to advocate for 
                colleagues in countries with fewer protections. Countries with stronger worker protections 
                are likely to lose work to regions where workers have fewer protections.
